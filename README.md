# URL-Shortner By Kobi Shamir
That project still not finished and I still have some work to do

Please follow the next steps to make the URL-Shortner work:


1. Clone project
2. In Terminal/CMD go to the directory where the project was downloaded
.. Run file "init_db.py" first - to build the DB with the table in the project directory
3. Run the file "app.py"
4. run:
       export FLASK_APP=app
       export FLASK_ENV=development
       flask run
       (if working in windows CMD replace export with SET)
5. go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Since it is still not finished, some problems may occur, for now, the only solution I can offer is to stop the process (ctrl + C) and repeat steps 2-5
