# URL-Shortner By Kobi Shamir
That project still not finished ang I still have some work to do 

Pleas follow the next steps to make the URL-Shortner work:


1. Clone project
2. In Therminal/CMD go to the directory where the project downloaded
.. Run file "init_db.py" first - to build the DB with the table in the project directory
3. Run the file "app.py"
4. run :
      export FLASK_APP=app
      export FLASK_ENV=development
      flask run
      (if working in windows CMD replace export with SET)
5. go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Since it still not finished, some problems may occore, for now the only solution I can offer is to stope the process (ctrl + C) and repeat steps 2-5
